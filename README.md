> Alles was Ã¼berhaupt gedacht werden 
kann, kann klar gedacht werden. Alles, 
was sich aussprechen lÃ¤sst, lÃ¤sst sich klar 
aussprechen. --Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Satz 4.116
(Everything that can be thought at all 
can be thought clearly. Everything that 
can be said can be said clearly.)

"The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you CAN make words mean so many different things."
"The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master." --Through the Looking-Glass
