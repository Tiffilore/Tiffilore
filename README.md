Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Satz 4.116:

> Alles was √ºberhaupt gedacht werden 
kann, kann klar gedacht werden. Alles, 
was sich aussprechen l√§sst, l√§sst sich klar 
aussprechen.

(Everything that can be thought at all 
can be thought clearly. Everything that 
can be said can be said clearly.)
